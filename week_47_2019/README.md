# #tidytuesday Week 47: NZ Bird of the year 2019 

This is my first time participating in a tidytuesday, please let me know how can I improve my work. Comments about how did I achived the results are inside my R scripts, let me know if something it's not clear.

In this week the idea was to show a visualization using the data derived from the New Zealand bird of the year voting. My idea was to watch how the five more voted birds behaive in the multiple rounds of the counting process.
