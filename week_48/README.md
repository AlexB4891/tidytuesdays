Student loan debts are a serious fact that many of my fellows are facing, may this attempt contribute to understand this problematic and help to reach out a solutions.

## Some notes:

- Consolidation means assum a new debt in order to pay the student loan
- Rehabilitation means that after an strinct payment plan, the defaults of the borrowers will be erased
- Wage garnishment meant that when the borrower begin to work, a portion of his wage will be retained to pay directly to the lender
