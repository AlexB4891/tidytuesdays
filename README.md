# tidytuesdays

In this repository I will load my works in the context of tidytueday.

By today the works done were:

- **Week 47, NZ bird of the year:** Each year in New Zealand voting is opened to choose the bird of the year, in this work I replicated the instant run-off voting (IRV) system with the tidyverse function's to see how the top 5 birds of 2019 behaive in the multiple round of counting.

- **Week 48, Student Loan Payments:** Student loan debts are a serious fact that many of my fellows are facing, may this attempt contribute to understand this problematic and help to reach out a solutions.

- **Week 49, Parking Violations in Philadelphia:** Money earned by fines are distributed among government agencies in order to improve it's resorces and services. Knowing which violations generates the most revenues in each agencie could lead people to ask for accountability of that money.
