# tidytuesdays

In this repository I will load my works in the context of tidytueday.

By today the works done were:

- **Week 47: NZ bird of the year:** Each year in New Zealand voting is opened to choose the bird of the year, in this work I replicated the instant run-off voting (IRV) system with the tidyverse function's to see how the top 5 birds of 2019 behaive in the multiple round of counting.
